## <a name="what"></a>What? (Features)

Can *your* shopping list tell you that you should buy new toilet paper? Procurista can! (or, at least, that's the goal...)

Goals: 

- keep any number of shopping lists.
- keep any number of items on the lists.
- easily add items from lists, and remove them as you buy the items.
- *let **Procurista** automatically add items you are running low on!*
- integrated barcode scanner so you don't have to search through your item list.
- integrated photo feature so you know exactly what the item looks like.

### <a name="wishlist"></a>Wish List

- at the moment, none of the above is implemented yet.
- developer contributions are welcome.

## <a name="why"></a>Why?

How often have you put something on a shopping list *after you've already run out?* Isn't that annoying? This project aims to change that: Procurista learns the purchase interval for each item and suggests the relevant items to the user before it's too late. No AI needed, just a little bit of clever statistics.

## <a name="how"></a>How? Contribute!
